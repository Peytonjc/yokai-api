<h1 align="center">Yo-kai Watch API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built API supplying information about your favorite yo-kai.</h3>



### :construction: This API is actively under construction! ###

#### Some Notes:

- Only Yo-kai that were released as part of the 'normal' medal range are currently included

- I plan to add more information about each Yo-kai as I am able

- If you haven't watched Yo-kai Watch you're really missing out. Check it out on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80106136)

#### Tech Stuff:

- This API was created using node.js and Express


#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- Documentation! I want this API to be easily navigated


### :star: Try it Out

- API is live at: [Vercel API page](https://yokai-api.vercel.app/api/yokai/whisper)
