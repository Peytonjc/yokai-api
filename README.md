<h1 align="center">Yo-kai Watch API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built API supplying information about your favorite yo-kai.</h3>



### :construction: This API is actively under construction! ###

#### Some Notes:

- Only Yo-kai that were released as part of the 'normal' medal range are currently included

- I plan to add more information about each Yo-kai as I am able

#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- Documentation! I want this API to be easily navigated by all fans

- Import data to MongoDB. As the data base grows, it only makes sense to store it in a cloud


### :star: Try it Out

- API is live at: ![Heroku API page]('https://yokai-api.herokuapp.com/')

- Initial client side page is live at: ![Client side page]('https://yokaiapi.netlify.app/')
