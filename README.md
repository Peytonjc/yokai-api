<h1 align="center">Yo-kai Watch API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built API supplying information about your favorite yo-kai.</h3>



### :construction: This API is actively under construction! ###

#### Some Notes:

- Only Yo-kai that were released as part of the 'normal' medal range are currently included

- I plan to add more information about each Yo-kai as I am able

- If you haven't watched Yo-kai Watch you're really missing out. Check it out on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80106136)

#### Tech Stuff:

- This API was created using node.js and Express

- Working with the backend is new for me, and I chose to learn by diving in the deepend with this API. It has been an education to be sure. I look forward to continuing to explore this part of my tech stack.

#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- Documentation! I want this API to be easily navigated by all fans

- Import data to MongoDB. As the data base grows, it only makes sense to store it in a cloud


### :star: Try it Out
